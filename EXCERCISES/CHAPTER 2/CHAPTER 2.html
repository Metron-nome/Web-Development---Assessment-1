        <p><strong>IGN: "Persona 5 is a massive, gorgeous JRPG with well over 100 hours of gameplay for completionists. 
            With more to do than ever and the series strongest story to date, it stands out as an extraordinary, memorable experience and easily one of the deepest JRPGs of the last decade. Its sprawling dungeon design and stylish, fully realized world are an absolute joy to explore, and even after three playthroughs and the Platinum trophy, I find myself itching to go back to try different dialogue options with Confidants or revisit particularly fun puzzles. 
            This is a new gold standard for Japanese RPGs and by far the best entry in the series yet."</strong></p>
        <p><strong>THEGAMER: "P5R takes everything good about Persona and makes it better, while taking everything bad about it and making it worse than you could have imagined."</strong></p>
